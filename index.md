<span style="font-size:20px;"> 
The vast and ever-growing volumes of semi- and unstructured text data—ranging from news articles, scientific publications, and historical records to travel blogs and social media posts—contain a wealth of geographic information hidden within toponyms, place attributes, and complex location descriptions. This latent geographic information presents an invaluable resource for exploration, analysis, and retrieval, offering significant potential across various fields, including spatial humanities, geographic search, disaster management, urban planning, disease surveillance, tourism planning, and landscape characterization.
</span>

<span style="font-size:20px;"> 
The Third GeoExT workshop is dedicated to foster discussion and exchange on recent advances in geographic information extraction from texts, with a focus on methodological innovations. Our goal is to establish a long-term forum to consolidate multi-disciplinary efforts from both researchers and practitioners in Europe and beyond.

<strong>The workshop is supported by the Working Group ([Global mapping for SDGs](https://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm4/icwg-4-3/)) of ISPRS Technical Commission IV/III.</strong>
